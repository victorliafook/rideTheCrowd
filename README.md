#Ride The Crowd

The proposed application will help gathering people who want to exercise themselves, doing a bike ride, a running workout or whatever other type of exercise in group.
The users will be able to join an event(so-called “Ride”) previously set up through the app or create a new “ride”, setting  for example a route, the initial and the ending point or just picking a static location. Once the user has created/joined the “ride”, they can exchange opinions and ideas in a small public chat and invite a friend to the event.
They can also discover the best places to do some exercise or sport, checking where people usually go; Add friends; Modify their profiles; Check their messages inbox and alter some app configurations.
